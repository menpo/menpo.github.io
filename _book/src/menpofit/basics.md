Basics
======
`menpofit` is an object oriented framework for building and fitting deformable models.
It makes some basic assumptions that are common for all the implemented methods.
For example, all deformable models are trained in _multiple scales_ and the fitting procedure is, in most cases, _iterative_.

In the following sections, we present the main concepts behind all methods implemented in `menpofit`. Specifically:

  1. [Importing Images](importing.md)
  2. [Training](training.md)
  3. [Fitting](fitting.md)
  4. [Fitting Result](result.md)
  5. [Visualizing Objects](visualization.md)
  6. [Running Experiments](experiments.md)
