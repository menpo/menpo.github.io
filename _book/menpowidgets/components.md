Widgets Components
==================
These are the main ingredients for synthesizing the [Main Widgets](main_widgets.md). They consist of a 2-level hierarchy:  

* [**Options Widgets**](options_widgets.md)  
  These are classes that implement widgets for selecting various options, such as rendering options, landmark options, channels options etc. They can be seen as the main components of all top level widgets.  
* [**Tools Widgets**](tools_widgets.md)  
  These are classes that implement lower level widget functionalities, such as colour selection, zoom options, axes options, etc. They are the main ingredients of the options widgets.
