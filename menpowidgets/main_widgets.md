Main Widgets
============
These are top-level functions for visualizig the various objects of the Menpo Project. They are separated into two categories:

* [**Main Menpo Widgets**](main_menpo_widgets.md)  
  These are the main widgets for visualizing objects of the [`menpo`](../menpo/index.md) package.
* [**Main MenpoFit Widgets**](main_menpofit_widgets.md)  
  These are the main widgets for visualizing objects of the [`menpofit`](../menpofit/index.md) package.

Note that these are the only functions that an end-user should use.
